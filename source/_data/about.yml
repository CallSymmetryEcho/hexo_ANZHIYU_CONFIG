        description: "At USTC's Chemistry Department, I focused on Theoretical Computation using DFT and MD simulations. I actively participated in academic competitions, won the awards and developed a tomographic 3D printer based on Kelly's work (Science, 2019), and conducted summer research at Brown University applying machine learning to chemical reaction dynamics under Prof. Rubenstein's guidance."

        description: "I joined Dr. Donglei (Emma) Fan‚Äôs group in 2021, focusing on Microrobotic Manipulation, Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) substrate engineering. My research includes nano-structure synthesis, self-assembly, and metal-assisted etching, alongside multi-scale simulations on photoelectric surfaces. Additionally, I work on utilizing electrical tweezers for precise, multi-degree-of-freedom control of nano-agents, with potential biomedical applications."
